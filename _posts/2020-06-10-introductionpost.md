#	Introduction

While I was at Flatiron I constantly was thinking of all of the possibilities that would befall me post graduation. There is app development, web development, front end focused stuff, back end focused stuff. There is a vast array (hash maybe?) of specializations and coding related jobs out there, and while recent graduates dont have to rush into anything super focused right off that bat, I thought it could be fun to try something that I have always wanted to try.

While at boot camp 2 thing tugged at my heart strings. Game development, and working for a non-profit. Non-profits use a wide variety of tech stacks, and while game dev projects wont really reflect my deep desire to get play a role in non-profits, I believe learning game dev will be a jurney that will give me a lot of great knowledge in development skills that are necessary all around. I could be wrong, but I will always have the foundations, and if I can learn game development, I dont see how it would be any different asking me to learn any other Tech Stack.

Anyway, This is my introduction post. I will be attempting to write a blog entry atleast every other day going through my journey or learning. Explaining all of my frustrations and woes, as well as boasting my accomplishments and exciting mile stones.

For the forseable future I will be writing posts, building my skills as a developer, working on my website, and searching for a job.
Here's to the code grind.
